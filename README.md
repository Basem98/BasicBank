# BasicBank
This is the first app that I create in C# as I am learning C# and the .NET environment.
This program was inspired by the book C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles, but I've added more functionalities to practice more concepts.
This is a console app that imitates the very basic functionalities that a bank system would provide.
It also provides a dynamically linked library that wraps the bussiness logic layer in order to separate the bussiness objects from the ui and can be interacted with through different UIs.
